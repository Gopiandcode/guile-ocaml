(** SCM is the user level abstract C type that is used to represent
   all of Guileâ€™s Scheme objects, no matter what the Scheme object
   type is. No C operation except assignment is guaranteed to work
   with variables of type SCM, so you should only use macros and
   functions to work with SCM values. Values are converted between C
   data types and the SCM type with utility functions and macros.  *)
